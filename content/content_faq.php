              <h4><i class="fa fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Pole dancing is for women.</h4>
                <p>DivaFit welcomes students of all genders!  While our aerial programs have always been open gender, this is a new policy for our pole programs, so changes will be rolled out gradually.  Open gender pole classes will be clearly marked on our <a href="https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/classic/home?studioid=22833">MindBody</a> schedule as they are implemented.  If you have any questions regarding this policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@divafit.online">info@divafit.online</a>.</p>
                

              <h4><i class="fa fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Pole dancing is only about being sexy.</h4>
              <p>Think again!  Yes, there is often a sexy element to pole dancing, but when approached in the light of competition, it transforms into a multifaceted sport that showcases grace and athleticism.</p>

              <h4><i class="fa fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Pole dancing is not a sport.</h4>
              <p>Pole dance is very new to the world of sports and is currently in the bidding process to become an Olympic sport.  There are pole sport competitions all over the country every year, including a locally held, regional competition that DivaFit students and instructors have been competiting in for the past three years!</p>

          <h4><i class="fa fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Can I start classes in the middle of a session?</h4>
            <h5>Pole</h5>        
            <p>Because our leveled pole programs build on skills learned in previous weeks, we do not recommend signing up for a leveled class mid-session.  Please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@divafit.online">info@divafit.online</a> to discuss leveled placement.  Follow the directions above for how to sign up for a session.  Your Start Date will reflect the next scheduled class, so you will be enrolled in only the remaining classes for the session.  The classes you missed will be credited to your account to use as makeup classes for any class at or below your current level.</p>
                    
            <h5>Aerial</h5>
            <p>You are welcome to sign up for a full session and can make up your extra classes at any class of your level or lower.  You may also opt to purchase single classes mid-session.

          <h4><i class="fa fa-caret-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> How do I make up a class?</h4>
          <p>In <a href="https://clients.mindbodyonline.com/classic/home?studioid=22833">MINDBODY</a>, you can click the "Sign Up Now" button for any ongoing class at your level or lower and you\'ll be able to use an existing credit to sign up for the class.
